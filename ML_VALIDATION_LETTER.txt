To Whom It May Concern:

This letter confirms that the Bago City Population and Development Office 
(BCPDO) approves and is satisfied with the CAPS2 System implemented for 
managing couple counseling services, including the Machine Learning (ML) 
component for generating counseling recommendations.

The CAPS2 System has been tested and evaluated. We are satisfied with the 
system's results and approve its use in managing our counseling services, 
including couple profile management, scheduling, questionnaire assessments, 
certificate generation, and ML-based counseling recommendations.

The system's features and recommendations are accurate, reliable, and suitable 
for use in our counseling services.

Respectfully yours,
